Hi, I’m Dmitry

I’m interested in programming with C++. Sometimes I can do something with other languages like C#, Java, Rust etc. 

I’m currently developing backend for messager with C++ + Boost and Desktop client with Qt.
I'm using docker to host database instances like PostgresQL, MongoDB. 

Also I develop several tiny projects with C# (.NET6) and Rust. I use also Kafka.
And I'm plannig to try using Redis for side project with Go.
