Hi, I’m Dmitry

I’m embedded and system software engineer. I develop firmwares for embedded devices and system software.

Also my hobby is a backend development. 

I use C, C++, Go, .Net, Rust, generally I develop pet-projects with Linux.
I have experience with the PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Apache Kafka. Also I liked gRPC and Protobuf technologies.

Also I have a little experience in GameDev with Unity.
I like to try new technologies.
