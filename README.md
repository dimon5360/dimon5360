Hi, I’m Dmitry

I’m embedded software developer.
Also my hobby is system and backend development. 

I use C, C++, .Net, Go, Rust, generally I develop pet-projects with Linux.
I have experience with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, Apache Kafka and also I liked Google's gRPC and Protobuf technologies.

Also I have a little expirience with GameDev.
I like to try new technologies.
